# Lab 4: Linear and Binary Search

Given a list containing a list of numbers, find a number in the list using linear search and binary search algorithms.

```python
def linear_search(myl, token):
    found = False
    for number in myl:
        if number == token:
            found = True
            break
    return found

def binary_search(myl, token):
    found = False
    # initialize markers at the edges of the list
    left  = 0
    right = len(myl)-1

    while not found and left <= right:
        mid = (right+left)//2
        midvalue = myl[mid]

        if token == midvalue:
            found = True

        if token > midvalue:
            # for e.g. token is 7 and midval is 5, then
            # shift left marker to the right of mid
            left  = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return found

# Recursive Version
def binary_search_r(myl, token):
    print ("Searching for ", token, "in ", myl)
    left  = 0
    right = len(myl)-1
    mid   = (right + left)//2

    # Terminal conditions for the recursion
    if len(myl) == 0:
        return False
    if myl[mid] == token:
        return True

    # Preparing the arguments for the next recursive call
    if myl[mid] > token:
        myl = myl[:mid]
    else:
        myl = myl[mid:]
    return binary_search_r(myl, token)


# Main program starts here

if __name__ == '__main__':

    choice = input("Linear or Binary Search (l/b)? ")
    alist  = input("Enter the list of numbers ")
    token  = input("What to search for? ")

    if (choice == 'b'):
        alist = sorted(alist)
        print (binary_search(alist, token))
    else:
        print (linear_search(alist, token))

```

## Pre-Lab Questions

0. How to calculate midpoint of a list? Which operator is most relevant?
1. Both `Linear search` and `Binary search` expect that the input list to be always sorted. If the list is not sorted, both algorithms will not work. True or False? Explain.

## Post-Lab Questions

1. If the list has 10,000 unsorted positive integers and the number you are searching for is between 1 and 10, which search algorithm will you choose? Binary or Linear? Why?
2. The `bisection` algorithm (available in the Python standard library as the `bisect` module is useful for many applications). Use it to code up the Student Grading challenge available at http://j.mp/gradeCD. First read the **instructions** file for problem statement.

## Bonus

The code for binary search recursive is as follows:
![code](https://rawgit.com/kgisl/pythonFDP/master/img/binarySearchRecursiveCode.png)

The test image looks like this:

The binary search test output looks like this:
![code](https://rawgit.com/kgisl/pythonFDP/master/img/binarySearchTestOutput.png)

As per the test output, there are four calls made to the `binary_search_recursive` function before the result is arrived at. What change(s) must be made to the code to reduce the number of calls to three?

## Test First Teaching Binary Search

Refer to [cyberdojo-exercises repo](https://github.com/kgashok/cyberdojo-exercises/tree/master/binarysearch2) for actual tested code and test cases

- Use Slice to teach Binary Search, and use Binary Search as use-case for Slicing
- The code is very simple and elegant to teach and understand

```python
def binary_search(alist, token):
    '''uses slicing instead of left and right markers
    easier to explain, easier to understand by beginners
    '''
    while alist:
        mid = len(alist) // 2
        midvalue = alist[mid]

        if token is midvalue:
            return True
        if token < midvalue:
            # for e.g. token is 3, and midvalue is 5
            # throw/slice away the upper half
            alist = alist[:mid]
        else:
            # if token is 7, and midvalue is 5
            # throw/slice away the lower half
            alist = alist[mid + 1:]

    return False
```

### Version 2

- Presenting a non-slice version of the Binary search then become as the  
  the next logical step

```python
def binary_search(alist, token):
    left = 0
    right = len(alist)

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        midvalue = alist[mid]
        #print(f'\nmid:{mid}, midvalue:{midvalue}')
        if token is midvalue:
            return mid

        if token < midvalue:
            # move right marker to left of mid
            right = mid
        else:
            # move left marker to right of mid
            left = mid+1

    return -1

```
