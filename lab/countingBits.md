<h1 id="led-counter">LED Counter</h1>
<p>A hobbyist project involves using a Arduino board to turn on and off several LEDs, letâ€™s assume there are 8 LEDs. The current status of the 8 LEDs that are turned on or off is captured in one single integer variable <code>led_status</code>. If a particular bit is set to value <code>0 (zero)</code>, the corresponding LED is turned off.</p>
<p>Write a function  which accepts this integer variable <code>led_status</code> as input and returns the count of the number of LEDs that are currently switched on.</p>
<p><em>NB: There might be more bits in the integer variable than there are LEDs. In that case, it can be assumed that those bits will also be set to 0 (zero).</em></p>

<p>Is it possible to write a one-line code for this in Python?</p>
